# Hyprland rules.conf
# Safe, minimal rules for floating certain apps and centering dialogs.
# Add more rules here as you need them.

# Float common media/image viewers and control panels
windowrulev2 = float, ^(?i)(mpv|feh|pqiv|sxiv|pavucontrol|blueman-manager)$
windowrulev2 = center, ^(?i)(mpv|feh|pqiv|sxiv)$

# Float dialogs (case-insensitive match)
windowrulev2 = float, ^(?i)(.*dialog.*)$
windowrulev2 = center, ^(?i)(.*dialog.*)$

# Examples (commented):
# windowrulev2 = float, ^(?i)(virt-manager)$
# windowrulev2 = move, ^(?i)(firefox)$  # move to a workspace (adjust and test syntax)

# NOTE: If you previously had a "float all" rule, keep it commented out
# here. Be careful with move/workspace rules — test them before making many changes.
